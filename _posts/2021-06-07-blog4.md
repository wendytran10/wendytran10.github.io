### Overall, what did you achieve in your project? 
Overall, in our project we achieved building a machine learning model that was able to classify tumor types given an MRI image. We were able to create a highly accurate brain tumor classification model, which would have extremely useful implications in the clinical setting. Our machine learning model could be used for diagnosis purposes while evading invasive procedures, such as brain tissue biopsies.



### What are two aspects of your project that you are especially proud of? 
One aspect of our project that I am especially proud of is the the accuracy of our model. We were able to achieve about  ~95% accuracy with the data that we found online. One thing that we found especially hard with our original dataset was that it did not include the necessary data that we needed, namely tumor masks. Despite this, we did a lot of extensive research to collect the data we needed to achieve results for our project. Even though we found the data that we needed, it was not properly processed, so I am also very proud of how much work we put in to get our data into the necessary formatting.  <br>



Another aspect of our project that I am especially proud of is our evaluation of our model. Although we were able to achieve high accuracy, we still wanted to evaluate our model for further improvements and to make note of any biases. We had noticed through our confusion matrix that our model was not as accurate at distinguishing meningioma tumors from glioma tumors. We then decided to plot the images that were being misclassified and found that the images were taken from a sagittal plane. Knowing that our model does not perform well with sagittal brain MRI images is an important aspect to take into account and leaves a place for further improvement. Overall, the evaluation process is an extremely important aspect to consider when building any machine learning model because if our model was used in the real world we wouldn't want it to cause further damage implicitly. 

### What are two things you would suggest doing to further improve your project?
To further improve our project, I would suggest that we build another model that could perform image segmentation. With the data that we downloaded (`.mat` files), we had a lot of difficulty configuring the images into the right dimensions, which made it hard for the model that we built for image segmentation to show anything meaningful (see image below :/).

Another improvement that we could make to our project is using generators to load in our data set. Every time we ran the code, it took about 40 minutes to load in all the data. Using a generator would have possibly sped up our run time as we wouldn't need to load in all of the data into our computer's RAM. 

### How does what you achieved compare to what you set out to do in your proposal? 
I would say that what we achieved in our final project would be considered "half-success" when first writing our project proposal. In our original project proposal, we had planned to create a website that allowed users to upload an image and have our model predict its brain tumor type as well as the region of brain tumor. Although we did not have time to build the website, we were able to create a code repository that included our model and all the preprocessing we had to do with our data in order to train the model. 


### What are three things you learned from the experience of completing your project? 
One thing that I learned while doing this project is how to use different Python packages such as `Keras` and `Tensorflow` to build a convolutional neural network for image classification. Additionally, I learned about a topic called "image augmentation", which we used in our own project to create more training data. I also learned how to use GitHub for project version control, which was really cool since working on a jupyter notebook and renaming and sending a new file every time someone makes a change can be very tedious and inconvenient.


### How will your experience completing this project will help you in your future studies or career? 
My experience completing this project has already helped me immensely in my studies and career. In the future, I plan on working in the computational biology field and this project has given me insight on the kinds of applications that are available at the intersection of computer/data science as well as biology. Additionally, completing this project with my partner gave me insight on to what it would be like working on a coding project and using GitHub. Overall, after completing this project I feel more confident in my Python skills and ability to problem solve.
