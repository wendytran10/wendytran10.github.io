In this blog post, I will be reviewing how to create a data visualization of the [Palmer Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) data set.

## About the data
The [Palmer Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) data was collected from 2007 - 2009 and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station Antartica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/). It contains different size measurements for three penguins species on three islands in Palmer Archipelago, Antartica.

## Retrieving the data
The `pandas` package is a useful tool in Python for working with tabular data, such as the Palmer Penguins data set, which is stored as a `csv` file.\
\
In order to create a data visualization, we will first need to read the data into Python as a `pandas` DataFrame by running: 
```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
\
Now we can easily work with our data in Python. Let's take a closer look at the Palmer Penguins data set:
```python
penguins.head()  
```
The following line should give us an output that looks like this:

The table above only shows a small snippet of the Palmer Penguins data set. One way we can learn more about the entire data set without looking at each individual row (which is not only ineffective, but also time-consuming) is by creating a visualization! 


## Accomplishing our goal...
In this demonstration, I would like to create a figure plotting the Culmen Length (mm) and Culmen Depth (mm) of each penguin on the three different islands. Within each plot for each island, I would also like to be able to make the distinction between species. Here's how we can do that: 
### 1. Data cleanup
First, we will need to prepare our data. For the purposes of this demo, we will only need to make minor changes. Looking at the `penguins` DataFrame we created, we see that the species name for each penguin is quite long. We can reduce the species name to one word by doing the following: 

```python
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
```
Now, looking at our modified `penguins` DataFrame we see only one word for the species name for a particular penguin. 
```python
penguins.head()
```

There are many more ways you can prepare this data set depending on what your goal is, but for now this all the preparing we will need to do. Let's move on to creating the actual visualization!


### 2. Creating the visualization
Luckily for us, Python supports another package called `matplotlib` with the module `pyplot` that allows for easy data visualization. By using the `pyplot` module from the `matplotlib` package in conjuction with operations supported by `pandas` data frame, we can easily achieve our task.  

#### 2.1 Create the axes for each figure
First, we will create one figure with three different axes to plot the culmen length and culmen depth data for each Island. 
```python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
# retrieve the unique islands
islands = penguins["Island"].unique()
# creates a plot with enough axes to plot data for each island
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, len(islands), figsize = (15, 3), sharex = True, sharey = True)
```

![bp-0-empty-plot.png](/images/bp-0-empty-plot.png)

#### 2.2 Using dictionaries and the `groupby()` method
We will use two different dictionaries to help us determine the axis at which to plot our data as well as determine the kind of colors we want each species to be. In my example, I want the penguins found on Torgersen to be plotted on the first graph, penguins found on Biscoe to be plotted on the second graph, and lastly penguins found on Dream to be plotted on the third graph. Additionally, <span style="color:blue">Adelie</span> penguins will be plotted in <span style="color:blue">blue</span>, <span style="color:orange">Chinstrap</span> penguins will be plotted in <span style="color:orange">orange</span>, and <span style="color:green">Gentoo</span> penguins will be plotted in <span style="color:green">green</span> .

```python
# dictionary to assign islands to axis indices
axis_to_island = {"Torgersen": 0,
                  "Biscoe"   : 1,
                  "Dream"    : 2 }
# dictonary to assign species to color
species_color = {"Adelie" : "tab:blue", 
                 "Chinstrap" : "tab:orange", 
                 "Gentoo" : "tab:green"
}
```

One thing extremely powerful that is supported by `pandas` DataFrame is the `groupby()` method. It allows us to **split** our DataFrame into pieces, one for each island and species, and **apply** an aggregation function in which we can plot the corresponding culmen length and culmen depth for each group. \
\
More specifically, by grouping the `penguins` DataFrame by `Island` and `Species` we will first acquire a subset of penguins composed of Adelie penguins from Biscoe Island, then Gentoo penguins from Biscoe Island, followed by Adelie penguins on Dream, and so forth. For each subset of penguins, we want to apply our aggregation function in which we use the `scatter()` method of `pyplot`. `scatter()` allows us to conveniently create a scatter plot of the culmen depth vs. culmen length. `scatter()` also has parameters, such as `alpha` that controls the transparency of each datapoint, `label` which labels the penguin's species, and `color` which assign each data point a color. \
\
Here's how we can these method from `pandas` and `matplotlib` to create an appealing and informative visualization:
```python
def plot(df): 
    """
    Plots the Culmen Length and Culmen Depth of each species by island.
    Input: df, user-inputted dataset as a pandas data frame
    """
    
    # determines which subset of penguins (based on island and species) to plot
    current_island = df["Island"].iloc[0] 
    current_species = df["Species"].iloc[0]
    # determine what axis to plot the data on
    i = axis_to_island[current_island]

    # plot the data
    ax[i].scatter(df["Culmen Length (mm)"],
                 df["Culmen Depth (mm)"],
                 alpha = 0.5,
                 label = current_species,
                 color = species_color[current_species])

    # gives each axis in the figure a title
    ax[i].set_title(current_island)
    # show the legend
    ax[i].legend()
    # horizontal and vertical axes
    ax[i].set(xlabel = "Culmen Length (mm)") 
    ax[0].set(ylabel = "Culmen Depth (mm)")

penguins.groupby(["Island", "Species"]).apply(plot)
```
\
By running the above code, we get the following visualization:
\
![bp-0-plot.png](/images/bp-0-plot.png)


Cool! We're done creating the plot. But, what does the figure show us? 

### Interpreting our visualization
From our figure above, we can note a few details:
- Torgersen Island only has Adelie penguins
- Biscoe Island has both Adelie and Gentoo penguins
- Dream Island has both Adelie penguins and Chinstrap penguins 
- Gentoo penguins on average have a longer culmen length (mm) and shallower culmen depth (mm) than Adelie penguins
- Chinstrap penguins have similar culmen depths (mm), but on average have longer culmen lengths (mm) compared to Adelie penguins

### Conclusion
Depending on what your goal is, the above visualization may or may not be useful. However, there are many other ways we can utilize the `groupby()` method and other methods supported by `pyplot` from `matplotlib` to create useful data visualizations. Overall, we can use Python to create data visualizations, which is a useful tool when we want accessible ways to see and understand tends, outliers, and patterns in data.
