$$f(x) = e^x$$

Talking about Python code:

```python
def f(x):
	"""
	A cool function that multiplies an input by 3
	"""
	return 3*x
```

```python
print("to boldly go")
```
```
to boldly go 
```

```python
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
x = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 1001)
y = np.sin(x)
plt.plot(x, y)
```

In my first draft of my code, I computed the logistic sigmoid function on a list of values using:
```python
import math
def sigmoid(X):
    return [1 / (1 + math.exp(-x)) for x in X]
```
One of my peer reviewers pointed out to me that my code would be faster on large data sets and be more compatable with scientific Python libraries if I assumed that the input and output were Numpy arrays.
```python
import numpy as np
def sigmoid(X):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-X))
```
