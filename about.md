I am currently a senior at UCLA pursuing a major in Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology and a minor in Bioinformatics. I am particularly interested in learning how to leverage different types of sequencing data to study complex diseases, such as cancer. I am currently taking PIC16B to further my computational and programming skills in order to be better suited for the kinds of data analysis that is needed in Bioinformatics. 

### More Information

In my free time, I enjoy going on hikes and taking trips to the beach. I have also recently adopted an adorable Siberian Husky named Calvin!<br>
